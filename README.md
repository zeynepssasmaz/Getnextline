## 42 Curses Get_next_line 

This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor.While doing this project, we will learn static variables, reading and printing from multiple files line by line.

### Allow Function

```c
read(), malloc(), free()
```

### Mandatory part

> <i> Rules:
> - **Function name**: get_next_line
> - **Prototype**: char *get_next_line(int fd);
> - **Turn in files**: get_next_line.c, get_next_line_utils.c, get_next_line.h
> - **Parameters**: fd: The file descriptor to read from
> - **Return value**: Read line: correct behavior NULL: there is nothing else to read, or an error occurred
> - **Description**: Write a function that returns a line read from a
file descriptor
> - Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time
> - Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
> - Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
> - **Please note** that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character
> - Your header file **get_next_line.h** must at least contain the prototype of the **get_next_line()** function.
> - Add all the helper functions you need in the **get_next_line_utils.c** file.
> - A good start would be to know what a [static variable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/) is.

### Bonus Part
> - Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
> - Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be
able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each
file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.
It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then
fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.
> - Append the _bonus.[c\h] suffix to the bonus part files.
It means that, in addition to the mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following
files:
> - get_next_line_bonus.c
> - get_next_line_bonus.h
> - get_next_line_utils_bonus.c

## Usage
   
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeynepssasmaz/getnextline
gcc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c BUFFER_SIZE=n
gcc get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c BUFFER_SIZE=n
```
